## why does this exist?

because i wanted harpoon, oil, and everything declared in nix. 
that's it. that's the pitch.

<br>

## what makes this different?

probably nothing! but it's:
-  fully reproducible (it's nix)
-  actually my daily driver 
-  not trying to be an IDE
-  honest about what it is


<br>

## features


-  harpoon for instant file jumping
-  telescope + ripgrep fuzzy finding
-  neo-tree + oil.nvim (browse + edit as files)
-  LSP ready (lua, nix, rust, C, python, java and js out of the box)
-  auto-formatting on save
-  lazygit integration
-  session persistence
-  tokyo night storm
-  lazygit integration
